A synergy stimulus for the masses.

The problem
-----------

In medium and large organisations and in general public there is often insufficient proliferation of information. Individual stakeholders know what could be improved, and sometimes how to improve it, but often the organisational barrier to share their concerns is too high.

The solution
------------

Let people share their experience and concerns with other members of organisation or society on all levels in a way, that is

*   __easy__,
*   __non-obtrusive__ and
*   __engaging__.
    
Allow decision makers to __track__ and to __analyse__ issues and to __engage__ in dialog with other stakeholders.

User stories
------------

Stakeholder can:

*   fill his / her profile, with following data
    * name
    * telephone number
    * list of departments / units / groups / organisations
    * occupation or role in organisation or society
*   share an issue, with following details
    * description (text)
    * scope (e.g. whole organisation, department, process, location, group)
*   list issues
*   view an issue
*   mark an issue as directly affecting him / her
*   mark an issue as concerning to him / her (i.e. important to organisation, but not necessarily directly affecting him / her)
*   mark his commitment to improve the issue (let other's know about commitment)
*   suggest who should take interest in this issue
*   comment on an issue
*   list closed issues (see below)

Commited and affected stakeholder can:

*   change issue details (update it)
*   close an issue (mark as no longer concerning the organisation)
*   reopen closed issue

Above list is not exhaustive and will be filled with further stories. This is a minimal set of interactions.
