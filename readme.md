A synergy stimulus for the masses.

The problem
-----------

In medium and large organisations there is often insufficient proliferation of information.

The solution
------------

Let people share their experience and concerns with other members of organisation on all levels in easy, non-obtrusive way. It has to be dead simple and engaging to share issues, to track and to analyse them.

User stories
------------

Person can:

* share an issue
* list issues
* view an issue
* mark an issue as affecting him / her
* mark an issue as important to organisation in his / her opinion
* mark an issue as being attended by him / her (become attender to the issue)
* suggest attenders for an issue
* comment on an issue
* close an issue (mark as no longer concerning the organisation)
* list closed issues
* reopen closed issue (see below)
